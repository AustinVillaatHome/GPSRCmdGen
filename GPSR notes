GPSR - Three questions.

Robot is asked question

Robot repeats question. Can ask for clarification if information is missing. -- Needs to be able to understand and incorpoarte the answer, but should be about known objects so hopefully not too hard. If category or abstract object than that should trigger clarification.
--Can ask for operator to repeat question 3 times. --could try to integrate speech rec over all three or take best, need to test.
--We can use custom operator or bipass speech at any time, but three repeats and the question is failed.
--Robot can ask for additional information if partially understood the question. --Unclear how often it can ask for additional info...
--Robot should recognize and ask for missing information.

Some questions are vague, look for x in the x or find the x in the x or locate x in the x.
-Robot can do whatever they want, but needs to be natural
"Look for the soap in the bathroom"
    *Clearly state where is the soap (e.g. "The soap is on top of the washing machine").
    *Point at the object at grasp distance and state that the soap is there.
    *Pick the soap and deliver it to the operator (also scoring for picking an object).

**Missing Info
When a given command lacks of information required for accomplishing the task, the robot should request for that missing part.  For instance, if the robot is instructed to “offer a drink to the person at the door”,
it may ask “which  drink  should  I  deliver  to  the  person  at  the  door?” It is also possible that the robot simply confirms the command and takes a random drink from the drinks location, but in those cases, the jury will consider the command as if it were from an inferior/lower category.

**Wrong Info
Some Category III commands contains erroneous information.  In these cases, the robot should
-be able to realize such an error while trying to carry out the task, get back to the operator, and clearly state why it wasn’t able to accomplish the task; or
-be able to solve the problem by means of an alternative, reasonable solution.
