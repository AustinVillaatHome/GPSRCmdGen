=================
Strategy for Cat 1 simple
=================
3 things go, get, follow, or find
We really need following to be super good. Can use HRI to make it easier. Say slow down or wait up.
-unclear what to do when finding objects

incomplete:
-put object in room (with no location). Need to ask for location, should be easy to detect.
-fruits (apple)
-find someone in a group need to figure out who it is (they might be doing a specific gesture)
-escort him ... (destination unspecified)
-When finding things need to ask what to do with them.
-Person without location.

erroneous:
-item not in specified room
-person not in specified location
-person can't walk
-person blocking access
-item not at predefined location
-special question from this grammar
-name given for person is incorrect
-object out of reach


=============
Cat 2
============
simpl.
Need to be able to recognize people, follow and guide, and recognize gestures and poses and clothing colors, genders, and ages and be able to describe someone.

incomplete.
Ask about person to talk to.
room given but not location.
reference people, but not room.

erroneous:
-all paths blocked to room
-people all lying down
-someone will abort the test partway through guiding/following...
-nobody in room
-follow walker through congestion
-people not facing robot




===========
Cat 3
===========
open and close doors, bring items on tray, describe items in a location, search for an object in a location. Deliver stuff (tea??!!) pour cereal. Arrange things. place things in specific locations.

incomplete:
-non-specific door to open or shut
-room but no location specified
-object specified but no location
-category but not specific

erroneous:
-person blocking door
-door already closed/open
-person at different location
-person using oven/ standing at location
-no object
-ask to pour something no pourable into something not a container
-robot can't reach
-nonsense phrases like "Hand me some containers from the cookies on the cupboard"
-all paths to destination are blocked
